          <h2>DUBROVNIK TRAVEL GUIDE</h2>
          <time>anuary 10, 2022 </time>

          <div class="news-single__text">
            Located on the southern coast of Croatia, Dubrovnik is the most popular destination in the country. Already
            a booming tourist destination, it was made significantly more popular by Game of Thrones (which filmed here
            regularly) as well as a recent influx of cruise lines.
            On everyone’s radar these days, Dubrovnik is beautiful and everything you might want it to be. The city is
            one of the wonders of Europe, combining a fantastically preserved medieval town surrounded by thick,
            24-meter (80-foot) high walls with a glimmering azure sea as its backdrop. It’s simply striking.
            And, as a bonus, the food and wine scene here has improved by leaps and bounds, and accommodations are
            plentiful and world-class.
            While Dubrovnik does struggle with over-tourism, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t go. Just be prepared for
            crowds in the summer (though I would totally skip the summer and go in early spring or late fall). If you
            get out of the old walled city, you can find a ton of places in the new part of town and in the surrounding
            regions that are free from the hordes of tourists.
            This travel guide to Dubrovnik can help you plan your trip and beat the crowds as you explore Croatia’s
            iconic destination.

            Walk the medieval city walls
            Walking the walls, which were constructed in the 12th-17th centuries and are still incredibly well
            preserved, is an obligatory activity for first-timers in Dubrovnik. It’s not cheap (and the price seems to
            go up just about every year), but the 2 kilometer (1.2-mile) journey around Old Town, or Stari Grad, is
            worth the price. With parts of the walls reaching a maximum height of 25 meters (83 feet), this is the best
            way to view the city from above. Along the length of the walls, there are an impressive 4 gates, 2 round
            towers, 2 corner towers, 12 forts, and 5 bastions. Admission is 250 HRK.
            Spend time on Lokrum Island
            Lokrum, just a 15-minute ferry ride away, is a peaceful, verdant island, ideal for swimming and sunbathing.
            It boasts hiking trails, viewpoints, a fortress built by Napoleonic soldiers, and a botanical garden.
            There’s even a mini “Dead Sea” on the island — a small, calm lake with very high salt content, in which one
            can float. Locals also swear that the restaurant Lacroma has the best fried calamari in Croatia. Ferries run
            every 30 minutes June to September and hourly during the low season (200 HRK round-trip). You can find the
            schedule here.
            Trek up to Fort Lovrijenac
            Game of Thrones fans will recognize this imposing citadel as the Red Keep from King’s Landing. Nicknamed
            “the Gibraltar of Dubrovnik” (you’ll know why once you lay eyes on it), this 11th-century fort just outside
            the western walls of Old Town was built in an attempt to keep the dreaded Venetians from invading — and it
            succeeded. The walls facing the sea are 11-meters (39-feet) thick, allowing Dubrovnik — then called the
            Republic of Ragusa — to remain an antonymous city-state beyond the control of Venice (this lasted all the
            way up to 1808, before it succumbed to Napoleon and then the Austro-Hungarian Empire). With your ticket to
            the walls, you get entry to this fort and thus a very different angle and view of the city. And a very good
            one at that.
